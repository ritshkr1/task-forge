# How I Plan My Coding Projects - 9 Steps

A streamlined process to take a project from idea to execution efficiently.

---

## 1. Start from the Goal
- Ask:
  - Why am I making this project?  
  - Who is it for?  
  - What makes it valuable?  
- Your goal determines stack, features, and coding approach.

## 2. Write User Stories
- Simple, user-focused statements:
  - Example: "User can upload a file"  
- Focus on what the app does for the user, not technical details.  

## 3. Define Data Models
- Sketch entities and relationships:
  - Example: Users, Posts, Comments  
- Decide what data needs to be stored and how it relates.  
- Don’t worry about DB technology yet.  

## 4. Nail Down the MVP
- Keep only essential features.  
- Cut unnecessary complexity to avoid scope creep.  
- Example: For a task app, MVP = create, mark complete, delete tasks.  

## 5. Draw a Basic Prototype
- Low-effort wireframes (paper or tablet).  
- Focus on layout and flow, not aesthetics.  
- Catch UX problems before coding.  

## 6. Think About the Future
- Determine project scale:
  - Hobby project, portfolio, or scalable production app?  
- Avoid overengineering or underengineering based on expected growth.  

## 7. Define Architecture
- Decide project type: script, web app, mobile app, browser extension.  
- Identify core components: frontend, backend, database, APIs.  

## 8. Pick the Tech Stack
- Choose tools after defining the project.  
- Keep stack simple, familiar, and deployable.  
- Avoid unnecessary complexity for the sake of new tech.  

## 9. Development Process
- Create project skeleton (folders, version control).  
- Build database models → backend routes → frontend.  
- Test early and often.  
- Deploy early and iterate gradually.
