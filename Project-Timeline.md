# üóÇÔ∏è Project 1: Task Forge (Task Manager)

## Overview
A task management web app where users can create, update, delete, and track tasks with deadlines and priorities.  
This project is the foundation to showcase **MEAN stack basics** with clean, deployable output.

---

## Core Features
1. User authentication (login/register with JWT).  
2. CRUD operations for tasks.  
3. Filters (by status, deadline, priority).  
4. Responsive Angular UI with forms & routing.  
5. Backend API with proper error handling.  
6. MongoDB integration with schema validation.  
7. Deployment: Frontend + Backend live with database.  

---

## Tech Skills Demonstrated
- Angular components, services, forms, routing.  
- Node.js + Express REST API design.  
- JWT authentication & middleware.  
- MongoDB CRUD + schema + indexes.  
- Git/GitHub usage with professional commits.  
- Deployment (Heroku/Railway + Netlify/Vercel).

## Timeline (7 Days Sprint Plan)

### **Day 1**
- Setup Angular + Node + Mongo boilerplate.  
- Create GitHub repo, push initial commit.  
- Setup basic backend server + connect to MongoDB.  

### **Day 2**
- Build Task model in MongoDB.  
- Implement backend APIs for CRUD tasks (`/tasks`).  
- Test APIs with Postman.  

### **Day 3**
- Create Angular components:  
  - Task List (display tasks)  
  - Add Task Form  
- Connect frontend ‚Üí backend (GET, POST).  

### **Day 4**
- Implement Update & Delete tasks in frontend.  
- Add task details page with Angular routing.  
- Handle API errors gracefully.  

### **Day 5**
- Add user authentication:  
  - Register/Login (JWT)  
  - Secure routes (only logged-in user sees tasks).  
- Middleware in backend for auth.  

### **Day 6**
- Add filters (by deadline, priority, status).  
- Polish UI (Angular Material / Bootstrap).  
- Write clean README with screenshots.  

### **Day 7**
- Final refactor (clean code, comments, error handling).  
- Deploy backend (Heroku/Railway).  
- Deploy frontend (Netlify/Vercel).  
- Update portfolio + GitHub with live demo link.

## End Deliverables
- Deployed live **TaskForge app**.  
- GitHub repo with clean commit history.  
- Professional README (features, screenshots, demo link).  
- Resume-ready project to showcase MEAN basics.
