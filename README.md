# Getting Started with Task Forge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Struture

---

## Working on Currently: 20 Nov
* Edit a task inline or open it in a modal for full details.
* Highlight the target column while dragging to show exactly where the task will drop.[Done]
* Show live task counts in each column header.[Done]
* Add new tasks quickly using a simple input at the bottom of each column.[Done]

## Core Features (Easy / Foundation)**

1. **Task CRUD** – Add, edit, delete, view tasks. [Done]
2. **LocalStorage Persistence** – Tasks remain after refresh.
3. **Task List / Board View** – Show tasks in columns (Todo, In Progress, Done).[Done]
4. **Add/Edit Task Form** – With basic validation (title, due date, priority).[In-progress]

---

## Task Interaction (Medium)**

5. **Task Detail Modal/Page** – Click task to see full details, editable.
6. **Filters** – Status, priority, due date, search.
7. **Sorting** – By priority, due date, or creation date.
8. **Task Assignment** – Assign tasks to users (name/email stored locally).

## State & UX Enhancements (Medium → Hard)**

9. **Context + useReducer State Management** – Manage tasks, boards, filters globally.
10. **Undo Delete** – Show toast/snackbar with undo option.
11. **Drag-and-Drop Tasks Between Columns** – Move tasks Todo → In Progress → Done.[Done]
12. **Task Comments / Activity Feed** – Add small comment history per task.
13. **Overdue Highlight / Reminder** – Visual cue for overdue tasks.

## Advanced & Recruiter-Impressing (Hard)**

14. **Board & Task Analytics** – Task count per status, progress bars.
15. **Dark Mode Toggle** – Context-based theme switcher.
16. **Responsive / Mobile-First Layout** – Works on all screens.
17. **Drag-and-Drop Sorting Within Columns** – Reorder tasks in same column.
18. **Visual Polish** – Smooth transitions, hover effects, cards, shadows.
19. **README + Demo** – GIFs/screenshots + live demo link (Vercel/Netlify).

✅ **Outcome:** By the end, Task Forge will have a **mini Jira clone** with:

* Kanban-style boards
* CRUD tasks with filters & sorting
* Drag-and-drop & undo functionality
* Analytics & dark mode
* Mobile-first responsive design
