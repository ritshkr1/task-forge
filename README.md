# Getting Started with Task Forge

Task Forge = mini-Jira, built right: feature-based Angular app, NgRx for state, clear storage adapter (local first, backend-friendly), full accessibility, testing, CI/CD, deployable to Vercel. Build *reusable primitives* and you’ll reuse them forever.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.1.

## Features**

### What's Done ?
1. **Task CRUD** – Add, edit, delete, view tasks.
2. **LocalStorage Persistence** – Tasks remain after refresh.
3. **Task List / Board View** – Show tasks in columns (Todo, In Progress, Done).
4. **Add/Edit Task Form** – With basic validation (title, due date, priority).

---
### What's In-Progress ?
## Task Interaction (Medium)**

5. **Task Detail Modal/Page** – Click task to see full details, editable.
6. **Filters** – Status, priority, due date, search.
7. **Sorting** – By priority, due date, or creation date.
8. **Task Assignment** – Assign tasks to users (name/email stored locally).

## State & UX Enhancements (Medium → Hard)**

9. **Context + useReducer State Management** – Manage tasks, boards, filters globally.
10. **Undo Delete** – Show toast/snackbar with undo option.
11. **Drag-and-Drop Tasks Between Columns** – Move tasks Todo → In Progress → Done.[Done]
12. **Task Comments / Activity Feed** – Add small comment history per task.
13. **Overdue Highlight / Reminder** – Visual cue for overdue tasks.

---

## Advanced & Recruiter-Impressing (Hard)**

14. **Board & Task Analytics** – Task count per status, progress bars.
15. **Dark Mode Toggle** – Context-based theme switcher.
16. **Responsive / Mobile-First Layout** – Works on all screens.
17. **Drag-and-Drop Sorting Within Columns** – Reorder tasks in same column.
18. **Visual Polish** – Smooth transitions, hover effects, cards, shadows.
19. **README + Demo** – GIFs/screenshots + live demo link (Vercel/Netlify).

---

✅ **Outcome:** By the end, Task Forge will have a **mini Jira clone** with:

* Kanban-style boards
* CRUD tasks with filters & sorting
* Drag-and-drop & undo functionality
* Analytics & dark mode
* Mobile-first responsive design
